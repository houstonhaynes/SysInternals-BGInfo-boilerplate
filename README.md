# A monitoring throw-back
Sysinternals BGInfo is a long-standing tool for server admins to put a quick-look view of system info on the desktop. Essentially it's a mini-app that runs on a timer and checks the Windows Management Interface (WMI) for info about the system, collates/massages it into a human-readable form (in some cases) and then embeds that info in the background image of the desktop. 

## Markdown with instructions

This repo mainly is to house the scripts and instructions, the latter can be found at the top level of this mini-repo.

### Future Project?

I'm currently considering writing a WinUI3 widget to cover this territory, but it'll have to wait for later in the summer. If anyone has any ideas or pointers to folks that are already ahead of me on that account, I'd love a link! *Thanks!*
